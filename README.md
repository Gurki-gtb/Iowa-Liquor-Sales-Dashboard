## Overall Takeaway 
This was a decently hard project. With the amount of scorecards and balancing of data, the dashboard can act up. However, although it was tough, it highlighted an area of Looker Studio that I need to work on. Overall, not my proudest work, but I'm happy with the outcome anyway. I'll definitely come back to this dashboard in the future and bring it up to par!
